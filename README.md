# 💰 Personal Loan Recommendation Engine

## 📍 Industry: Finance

### ❓ Problem
Many consumers are unaware of which personal loan products they qualify for based on their credit history and financial profile. Navigating loan options without expert guidance can lead to rejections or unfavorable terms.

### 🎯 Goal
Build a machine learning system that analyzes a user's credit and financial data to:
- Predict loan eligibility
- Recommend the most suitable personal loan options
- Estimate interest rate ranges

## ✅ Why This Project Works

- **ML-Powered**: Leverages classification or regression algorithms to predict loan approval and product suitability.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- **Pandas & Matplotlib**: Essential for data wrangling and visual analysis.
- **SQL or MongoDB**: Used to store user profiles, loan product data, and model output.
- **Frontend Options**: JavaScript + Plotly for interactive graphs, or HTML/CSS/Bootstrap for a clean, responsive UI.
- **Real-World Data**: Built on publicly available datasets such as Lending Club and Kaggle credit datasets (with >100,000 records).
